A non-alphabetized glossary of the more technical terms and phrases in ISLR. Terms are in order of introduction in the book.

**Mean squared error** or **MSE**: How snugly the model fits the data. **Training MSE** applies to training data, and **test MSE** applies to test data.  
**Bias**: The error that is introduced by using approximation.  
**Variance**: How drastically f^ changes between different training data sets.  
**Bias** and **variance** relate to model flexibility. As a model becomes more flexible, its **variance** increases and its **bias** decreases. That is, the model *fits* the training data more snugly.
